            I thrive in{" "}
            <strong>collaborative, team-oriented environments</strong> where
            ideas are openly shared, and everyone's strengths contribute to
            success. I bring <strong>strong communication skills</strong>, a
            willingness to share knowledge, and an open mind that helps foster
            effective collaboration.
